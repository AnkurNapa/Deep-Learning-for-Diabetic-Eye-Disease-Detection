## Introduction

Welcome to our project! 🌟 Here, we've developed a smart system that helps doctors detect a common eye condition in people with diabetes, known as Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), by simply looking at images of the eye. This is super important because DR is a leading cause of blindness, and catching it early can prevent serious vision loss.

## What's Inside?

In this repository, you'll find all the "behind-the-scenes" details of how we built this system. We used special computer programs called "neural networks" that can learn to spot tiny details in eye images that signal the disease's presence.

- 📂 **Code Files**: These are the recipe books for our project. Each file is a set of instructions that tells the computer what to do to find the disease in the eye images.
- 🖼️ **Data**: Think of this as the training school for our detective system. We showed it thousands of eye images, some with DR and some without, so it could learn the difference.
- 📊 **Results**: Here, we share how well our system did. We tested it by showing it new images it hadn't seen before and checking if it could correctly identify those with the disease.

## How It Works

1. **Learning from Images**: First, we fed our system lots of pictures, teaching it to recognize signs of DR. It's a bit like how you learn to recognize your friends' faces, just more complex!
2. **Making It Smarter**: We didn't stop there! We tried different methods to make our system even smarter, ensuring it doesn't get tricked easily.
3. **Testing It Out**: Finally, we tested our system with fresh images it never saw during the learning phase, much like a surprise quiz!

## What Did We Achieve?

Our smart system turned out to be a pretty good learner! It did a great job of identifying DR in images, sometimes even noticing details doctors might miss. This doesn't mean it's ready to replace human doctors, but it could be a valuable tool for them.

## Want to Know More?

We've laid everything out in detail in this repository. So, if you're curious, feel free to dig deeper into the folders. Who knows, it might inspire you to create a project of your own!

Remember, technology can be a force for good, and we're excited about its potential to help doctors save sight. 👩‍⚕️👁️

Thank you for stopping by, and we hope you find our project enlightening!
